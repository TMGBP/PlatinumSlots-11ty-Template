# RESPONSIBLE GAMING
Last updated: 07.07.2023

## HOW WE COMMIT RESPONSIBLE GAMING
For us, Responsible Gaming is the rational, sensible selection of gaming options by our clients; that is, an informed, educated decision by the players for the sole purpose of entertainment. Responsible Gaming is a leisure and entertainment activity and must never interfere with social, professional or family obligations. If a player thinks he is spending more money than he can afford, or in case gaming is starting to interfere with his normal daily routines, we strongly advise to consider several measures that can help, such as setting Personal Limits on the gaming activities, opting for Self-Exclusion or seeking help and support from trusted independent bodies.

2. A player can put the limits into his account in the “Responsible gambling” tab by making a request in chat/ by email or on contact form on the website.

Protection of minors. We are only accepting players who are at least 18 years old and use all available methods to stop any attempts of minors to register and play at our casino. We reserve the right to ask for proof of identity and in case the player has not reached the legal age to play, access to the website will be denied. However, we realize that due to a wide availability of Internet people under age still have a chance to register and play at an online casino. We therefore strongly encourage parents to cooperate in protecting their children from free access to gaming websites. There is special software that can help in this matter. There are several links on the website which can help with it.
